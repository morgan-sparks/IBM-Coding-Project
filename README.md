# IBM-Coding-Project
Group project to create our own IBM based on some ecological/evolutionary question

So far we are thinking this project will model pink salmon that were introduced into the great lakes. The plan is to play with different life history parameters to model them invading new habitats.

This will pair with theory about how to maximize dispersal, as well as bet hedging strategies (broods that return over multiple years vs. higher dispersal rates) for introducing genetic diversity and avoiding local extinction.
