# Ideas for Pink Salmon project
## Things to start adding to model
* add multiple populations
* add 3 yr olds
  1. column of age at maturity and column of age and when age at maturity == age they return
  2. heritability is a genetic or non-genetic component
* adding compensatory growth (adult carrying capacity vs juvenile carrying capacity)
* need to have a minimum number of fish in the population
* add in sex 
  1. Think about how pairing sexes will work for mating, also will there be a ratio of males to females where it is just not possible for males to mate more
* genetic component (e.g. SNP panel of 100 SNPs or something similar)

# Life history

* 2 yr old

* 3 yr old

# Factors controlling traits (maybe we don't do this)

* plastic response

* soft sweep (existing variation already present in pop)

* hard sweep (mutation arises in population)


# Ecological factors
Frequency dependence (fish more likely to be one trait if there are few indviduals)
  e.g. are fish more likely to spread risk across time if densities are low?

# Hypotheses: 
From Buoro and Carlson 2014 

*Overall, these studies have found that **spatial
dispersal** is favoured over temporal dispersal when (1) the environment
is only occasionally favourable, (2) the number of
suitable habitats increases, (3) the cost of spatial dispersal is
low relative to the cost of temporal dispersal, (4) conditions
differ among sites but are similar among years and (5) when
meta-populations are young and populations are characterised
by fast growth (see Levin et al. 1984; Cohen & Levin 1991;
Wiener & Tuljapurkar 1994; McPeek & Kalisz 1998; Olivieri
2001).*

*In contrast, **temporal dispersal** is favoured over spatial dispersal
(1) in small meta-populations, (2), when fitness failures
are likely to occur simultaneously in all patches of a
meta-population, (3) when the cost of spatial dispersal is high
relative to the cost of temporal dispersal, (4) when conditions
differ among years but are similar among sites and (5) in an
older meta-population with low population growth (see Cohen
& Levin 1991; Olivieri et al. 1995; Olivieri & Gouyon 1997;
McPeek & Kalisz 1998; Eriksson & Kiviniemi 1999).*
