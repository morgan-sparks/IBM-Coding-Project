# Ideas for Pink Salmon project

# Life history
* 2 yr old
* 3 yr old

# Factors controlling traits

* plastic response
* soft sweep (existing variation already present in pop)
* hard sweep (mutation arises in population)

#ecological factors
Frequency dependence (fish more likely to be one trait if there are few indviduals)
  e.g. are fish more likely to spread risk across time if there a few fish around?
