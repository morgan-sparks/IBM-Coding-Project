# Ideas for Pink Salmon project

# Life history

* 2 yr old

* 3 yr old

# Factors controlling traits

* plastic response

* soft sweep (existing variation already present in pop)

* hard sweep (mutation arises in population)


#ecological factors
Frequency dependence (fish more likely to be one trait if there are few indviduals)
  e.g. are fish more likely to spread risk across time if densities are low?

# Hypotheses: 
From Buoro and Carlson 2014 

*Overall, these studies have found that spatial
dispersal is favoured over temporal dispersal when (1) the environment
is only occasionally favourable, (2) the number of
suitable habitats increases, (3) the cost of spatial dispersal is
low relative to the cost of temporal dispersal, (4) conditions
differ among sites but are similar among years and (5) when
meta-populations are young and populations are characterised
by fast growth (see Levin et al. 1984; Cohen & Levin 1991;
Wiener & Tuljapurkar 1994; McPeek & Kalisz 1998; Olivieri
2001).
In contrast, temporal dispersal is favoured over spatial dispersal
(1) in small meta-populations, (2), when fitness failures
are likely to occur simultaneously in all patches of a
meta-population, (3) when the cost of spatial dispersal is high
relative to the cost of temporal dispersal, (4) when conditions
differ among years but are similar among sites and (5) in an
older meta-population with low population growth (see Cohen
& Levin 1991; Olivieri et al. 1995; Olivieri & Gouyon 1997;
McPeek & Kalisz 1998; Eriksson & Kiviniemi 1999).*
